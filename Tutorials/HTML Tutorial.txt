FIRST STEPS/INTRO:
    
    First file - index.html
        - web browser will think that its our homepage

    <!DOCTYPE html> 
        - defines, what a document type of file is gonna be
        - this is gonna be html document

    Container tags 
        - start tag and end tag and you can put another tags inside of them
        - it can be content or other html files 

    Starting tag: <html>
    Ending tag: </html>
        - basically starting tag with backslash after <
        - together they are paired tags
        - this one is main tag of our file, like overall container/
        highest level tag, contains all of data

    There are 2 more sets of tag you need to create:
    <head> tag - data of document/settings (type, image, resources)
    <body> tag - actually all of content

    <head> and <body> are inside <html>, so they need to be indented
        something like <html> is parent of <head> and <body>
        so <head> and <body> are kids of <html> because they are iside of if
        <head> and <body> are siblings

    <title> in <head> - defines name of webpage - before it was "index.html"
        i put text inside of it:
            <title>
                Peto's Website
            </title>

BASIC TAGS:
    Inside of these tags we have something called "attributes" or "properties"
    <meta charset="UTF-8">  
        - 1st in <head>
        - meta tag 
        - tells browser what characters im using
        - UTF-8 is like a basic set of characters
    <meta name="description" content="This is an awesome website">
        - 2nd in <head>
        - meta description tag
        - gives desc to the website
        - inside of this meta tag im telling what type of info i want to define
        (description) and im telling that what that description should be 
        (This is an...)
    <h1>
        - header tag
        - can be from <h1> to <h6>    
        - h2 will be smaller, h3 will be even smaller and so on...
    <p>
        - paragraph tag
        - anything that i will write inside of this will go into its own 
        paragraph
        - they will automatically format theyself, if im gonna put another <p> 
        bellow, it will be in its own paragraph (under it)
    <b>
        - paragraph for bold text
        - inside <p>, around text that we want to be bold
        <p>This is my <b>paragraph</b></p> - the word "paragraph" will be bold
    <i>
        - same as <b>, but this makes text italic
    
    * <b> and <i> can be used together
        <p>This is my <b><i>paragraph</i></b></p>
    * <h1> and <p> and any other tags will be shown in order as we write it
        if we write <h1> 1st and <p> 2nd, <h1> will be above <p>
        if we write <p> 1st and <h1> 2nd, <p> will be above <h1>
    * html files doesnt care about whitespaces, if you put random whitespaces
    in your code, it will be the same

    <br/>
        - break tag
        - adds whitespace to code, if youll hit just enter it will do nothing
        - you can use them as many as you want:
            <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> will make 5 empty lines
    <hr/>
        - horizontal rule tag
        - draws straing line across our webpage thats gonna help us to separate 
        some contents in our webpage

    * <hr/> tag is simillar to <br/> tag, these are called SINGLE TAG
        - there is nothing that needs to go inside of them, so they are single
        - lotta times they are gonna be formated this way
            <
            *name*
            /
            >
        - in certain cases we can get rid of / but its technically correct 
        like this
        - you can also put there as many as you want of the
    <big> and <small>
        <p><big>This is</big> <small>my</small> <b>paragraph</b></p>
        - in this case, it makes "This is" bigger and "my" smaller
    <sub> and <sup>
        - subscript and superscript / lower and upper index

COMMENTS:
    - comments are small pieces of code, that are going to be ignored by html
    - purpose of comments are yourself/other developers to read the code
    <!-- Redoing this or sth...
        this line is actually a comment and it wont be shown in our page 
    -->
    <!-- is open tag
    --> is close tag
    - there dont have to be anything in line after <!--, it just helps 
    you/someone other to know why is some lines of codes disabled 

STYLE AND COLORS:
    CSS - entire other subject
        - means "Cascading Style Sheets"
    <p style="color:blue">Text</p>
        "style="color:blue"" makes whole paragraph blue
    <p style="color:blue; background-color:red">Text</p>
        makes text blue and background red
    
    * this can be too done on headers or body
    * we can see that background color of <h3> overwrites color of <body>, 
    because it was printed after that, so its on top of it
    * website for colors:
        https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp
    * instead of color name (blue) you can put a hex tag inside (#0000FF)

FORMATTING A PAGE:
    * example of blog page

    <html>
        <head>
            <title>
            </title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <header>
                <nav>
                </nav>
            </header>
            <main>
                <arcticle>
                    <section>
                        <h3></h3>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <aside>
                        </aside>
                    </section>
                </arcticle>
            </main>
            <footer>

            </footer>
        </body>
    </html>

    * in webpage you should have one <h1> that will be like main header of 
    your webpage
    * bellow <h1> youll have <h2> which defines a different sections of website
    * after <h2> will be <h3> and so on...
    * its not required, but its a good practice that are lot of people gonna
    use when they are desingning they websites

    <aside>
        this tag will basically mean this content is on the page and its 
        getting shown to the users, but its not directly related to like the
        core content of our website

    * you dont have to use these tags, but its gonna help you to organize
    your webpage. One of your goal is to make the file as readable as possible

LINKS:
    * you needs to use special tag <a>
    <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Open google</a>
    * we just told this tag to open google when clicked
    target="_blank"
        - opens link in new tab
    * we can put any html tags inside  <a> *here* </a>
        <a><b></b></a>
    * we can link to other pages or files of our website
        <a href="image.jpg">Open google</a>
            this will open image on new tab. Image has to be in the same 
            directory

IMAGES:
    <img width="" height="" src="" alt="Really hard-working workers"/>
        * one of those SINGLE TAGs
        width and height
            sets width and height of picture :D
            can be number (pixels)
            image can be squished afrer resizing, so you need to check the 
            aspect ratio
            you can set either width or height and HTML will automatically 
            resize the second dimension in correct aspect ratio
        src = source of image
            inside of there can be weblink to an image or path to image of your
            device
        alt = what its gonna do if that image is deleted/unavailable/...
            inside of there can be a phrase thats gonna be shown is the image
            is unavailable
    you can combine images with link:
        <a href="image.jpg" target="_blank">
            <img width="500"  src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Pat_Mat.jpg" alt="Workers, who work really hard" />
        </a>

Videos & YouTube iFrames:
    <video src="video.mp4"></video>
        - add source of video
            src="location_of_video.mp4"
        - add controls so you can play, skip, ... the video
            controls
        - add width and/or height to change w/h
            width="800"
            height="600"
        - add poster to thumbnail
            poster="thumbnail_of_video.jpg"
        - add autoplay to play automatically when the page loads
            autoplay
        - add loop to start video over when it ends
            loop
    Youtube iFrame:
        - find video you want on YouTube
        - click share, then embed and copy it
        - paste copied code into your html file
        - you can change code to adjust width/height

LISTS:
    <ul>
        <li>Apples</li>
        <li>Oranges</li>
        <li>Bananas</li>
    </ul>
        - unordered list
        - you can put other html tags between <li>, such as <a href="">
    
    <ol>
        - ordered list
        - same as <ul>, but there will be numbers before items in list
        instead of dots
    
    <dl>
        <dt>Apples</dt>
        <dd>- They are red</dd>

    </dl>
        - <dl> - description list
        - <dt> - description term
        - <dd> - describe description term
        - you can put items <dt> inside a list <dl> 
        and describe them <dd>        
    
    - you can specify style of <ul> or <ol>:
        <ol type="1"> - 1. 2. 3. - default
        <ol type="A"> - A. B. C.
        <ol type="a"> - a. b. c.
        <ol type="I"> - I. II. III.
        <ol type="i"> - i. ii. iii.
    - you can also put lists inside of lists

TABLES:
    <table>
    <thead> - table head
    <caption> - title of table
    <tr> - row - horizontal
    <td> - table data - represents one column - vertical
    <th> - table header - bold <td>
    <td colspan="2">one</td> - column span - makes "one" to take 2
    places horizontally

    <table>
        <caption>List of numbers</caption>
        <tr>
            <td>one</td>
            <td>two</td>
            <td>three</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
        - three informations in one row + "List of numbers" title
    - you can define as much rows and columns as you want
    - <thead> and <tbody> doesnt have to be used, it allows us to format
    and organize our file better; its just a visual thing in our file,
    it wont change look of our table on page

SPANS & DIVS:
    - containers
    - helps you to organize your file better; when youre using CSS,
    you can apply something to container to apply something to all
    things in container 
    - inline elements and block elements:
        - inline display element <a href="">
            - in 1 line on page there can be as many <a> tag as there 
            can fit
        - block element <p>
            - in 1 line on page there can be just 1 <p> tag, even if 
            more can fit there
    - spans are inline elements
    - divs are block element

INPUT & FORMS:
    - if you want to learn how to get input from users, you need to learn
    JavaScript. We'll just be learning how to define things like text
    boxes and text areas
    
    <input type="text" value="Enter your username"/>
        - single tag - doesnt need </input>
        - type=""
            - there are lots of them
            - "text" - you can write there
            - "password"  - something like "text", but your INPUT
            will be hidden - replaced by "•"
            - "date"
                - dd/mm/yyyy
                - different on different browsers
            - "email"
            - "range"
            - "file"
            - "checkbox"
            - "radio"
                - radio button
                <input name="button" type="radio"/>
                - if some have the same name, only one at time can be
                checked
            - "submit"
        - value=""
            - main value - whats gonna be written before typing in
    <textarea>
        - like <input>, but its a lot bigger and can be resized
        - you can put default value between <textarea> and </textarea>
    <form><input></form>
        - stores input, useful when youre working with JavaScript

iFRAMES:
    - you can see another website inside your webpage
    <iframe src="https://www.google.com/" frameborder="0">Some text</iframe>
        - "Some text" is gonna be displayed if the page cant be viewed
        - you can add height and width
        - frameborder="0" hides grey frame around iframe
        - some pages will block access 

META TAGS:
    - used for metadata - data about data - we can define info about
    our webpage
    <meta name="description" content="This is an awesome website">
        - describes description of page - can be used for serch engines
        to help out to find whats your page about
        - about 160 is ideal; if its over 200, most search engines 
        will ignore it or even penalize you in search ranking
        - its very important, you should keep it brief
    <meta name="author" content="Peťo">
    <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, Tutorial">
        - search engine can use these to better search, similar to
        description
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        - this is gonna control how your website is gonna be displayed
        on different devices
        - without this, you will see the website same on mobile an PC




audio
    <audio id="meowClip" controls>
        <source src="audio/meow.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        <source src="audio/meow.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
    </audio>

figure/figcaption
    <figure>
        <img src="roundhouseDestruction.jpeg" alt="Photo">
        <br>
        <figcaption>
            Master Camper Cat demonstrates proper form of a roundhouse kick.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>

form, label, fieldset, legend
    - used with radio buttons

    example1
        <form>
            <label for="name">Name:</label>  <!-- for value has to be same as id bellow -->
            <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
        </form>

    example2
        <form>
            <fieldset>
                <legend>Choose one of these three items:</legend>
                <input id="one" type="radio" name="items" value="one">
                <label for="one">Choice One</label><br>
                <input id="two" type="radio" name="items" value="two">
                <label for="two">Choice Two</label><br>
                <input id="three" type="radio" name="items" value="three">
                <label for="three">Choice Three</label>
            </fieldset>
        </form>

tabindex, accesskey
